Linux utility scripts
=====================

This is a personal archive of (mostly) Bash scripts to make my life a little easier. They may or or may not be of use to anyone else.  

I use these across multiple Linux environments that are all modern Ubuntu based using at least Bash 4.3.  
  
Where applicable, I have tried to give attribution for any significant portions of non-original code.  
  
Feel free to clone, fork, modify, and send pull requests for obvious errors or omissions.

Enjoy!
